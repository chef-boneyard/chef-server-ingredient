# Deprecated

This cookbook is deprecated. Use [chef-ingredient](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-ingredient).

The chef-ingredient cookbook has the `chef_server_ingredient` resource as a compatibility shim only, and consumers of that resource are recommended to switch to the `chef_ingredient` resource immediately.
